Efficient allocation and utilization of computer resources such as CPU, memory, disk space, and peripherals.
Process Management:

Creation, scheduling, and termination of processes, ensuring optimal use of the CPU.
Memory Management:

Allocation and deallocation of memory space for processes, managing virtual and physical memory.
File System Management:

Organization, storage, retrieval, and manipulation of files and directories.
Device Management:

Handling communication with input/output devices, ensuring proper data exchange.
Security and Protection:

Implementation of security measures to protect data and resources from unauthorized access.
Types of Operating Systems
Single-User Operating System:

Designed for individual users, typically found on personal computers.
Multi-User Operating System:
